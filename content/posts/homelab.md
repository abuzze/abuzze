# Using a NUC i7 as an ESXi Server

### Why buying a NUC instead of a real server

I am using a [NUC i7 10710U](https://amzn.to/3zznGk0) with 32GB RAM and
a 1 TB SSD for my lab, mainly because of the small form factor and the low
power consumption. Setting up a 19'' Server is not an option for me and
the NUCs are a good learning platform, if you only need a few small VMs.
